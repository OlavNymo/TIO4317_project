Project proposal 
 
Research question 
We aim to forecast the S&P 500 closing index price for the period from Monday, February 
24th, to Friday, February 28th. Our objective is to analyze patterns in historical price 
movements and leverage forecasting techniques to predict short-term fluctuations in the 
index. 
Specifically, we will explore the following aspects: 
●  The impact of recent market trends on short-term price predictions 
●  The effectiveness of different forecasting models in predicting daily closing prices 
●  The role of external factors, such as economic events and market sentiment, in 
influencing forecast accuracy 
Our goal is to evaluate whether short-term forecasting methods can reliably capture 
movements in the S&P 500 and assess how different modeling approaches compare in 
terms of predictive performance. 
Data 
For this project, we have collected daily historical price data for the S&P 500 index (SPX) 
spanning a five-year period from February 24, 2020, to February 24, 2025. The dataset has 
been sourced from the Nasdaq website, which provides publicly available financial market 
data. 
The dataset includes the following key attributes for each trading day: 
●  Date: The trading day recorded in MM/DD/YYYY format 
●  Close/Last: The closing price of the S&P 500 index 
●  Open: The opening price of the index on a given trading day 
●  High: The highest price reached during the trading session 
●  Low: The lowest price recorded during the trading session 
This dataset serves as the foundation for our forecasting analysis, enabling us to examine 
historical price movements and apply predictive modeling techniques to estimate future 
index values. 
Code 
 
The group has selected Python as the primary programming language for this project due to 
its extensive capabilities in data analysis, statistical modeling, and forecasting. We will 
leverage various Python libraries, including statsmodels, pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, to 
conduct data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling. These libraries 
provide a comprehensive toolkit for implementing robust forecasting methodologies and 
evaluating model performance. 
 
Empirical design 
For this project, we will employ ARIMA and GARCH models to forecast the S&P 500 closing 
index price. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) will be used to model the 
time series' linear trends and autocorrelations, while GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive 
Conditional Heteroskedasticity) will be applied to capture volatility clustering and 
time-dependent variance in the data.  
The models will be estimated using Python libraries such as statsmodels and sklearn. We 
will optimize the model parameters by iterating through different lag orders and 
hyperparameter configurations. The selection process will involve minimizing Mean Squared 
Error (MSE) on a validation dataset to identify the best-performing model specifications. 
The predictive performance of the models will be assessed using multiple evaluation metrics: 
●  R² (coefficient of determination) to measure how well the model explains variance in 
the data. 
●  Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to quantify the average prediction error in the 
same units as the index price. 
●  Additional diagnostic checks, such as residual analysis and backtesting, will be 
performed to ensure model robustness and reliability. 
This empirical approach will allow us to compare the effectiveness of different models and 
determine the most suitable forecasting method for short-term S&P 500 price movements.
